=========================
Creating a Workstation VM
=========================

This page documents the process of creating a Linux virtual machine that can be installed on a user's workstation.


Most of the commands you will type in the Linux virtual machine will be typed as `root`.  To become `root`, type the following at a command prompt::

    $ su - root
    [enter root password]

As per convention, variables in this documentation are written in upper case with underscores, starting with a "$" sign.

Prepare For The Install
=======================



SSH Client and Terminal Emulator (optional)
-------------------------------------------

You may find it significantly easier to connect to your VM from your host OS via SSH, rather than interacting directly though the VM's window.

Windows:

* `PuTTY <https://duckduckgo.com/PuTTY>`_
* `Cygwin <http://cygwin.com/>`_

Mac OS X:

* Already has SSH which you can access via the built-in Terminal app.

Linux:

* If you're already using Linux you probably figure this out for yourself.



Install VirtualBox
------------------

Download VirtualBox from the official web site and install it.

- https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- Look for "VirtualBox $VERSION_NUMBER for Windows hosts".
- Also download the "VirtualBox $VERSION_NUMBER Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack".
- When all files are downloaded, launch the installer and install on your host machine.

.. note::
    During the installation process on Windows, you may encounter warning messages from Windows Firewall and/or AV security software. You should choose "Allow" or "OK" for all of these dialogs. 

Install the VirtualBox Extension Pack.

- Run VirtualBox.
- In the "VirtualBox Manager" window, click "File > Preferences" and select the "Extensions" tab.
- Click the "Add package" icon on the right side of the window.
- Locate the "VirtualBox $VERSION_NUMBER Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack" that we downloaded earlier, then click "OK".



Host-only Network
-----------------

By default, VMs can only connect to the outside Internet.  VirtualBox's host-only network is used for communications between VMs and with your host OS.

- In the "VirtualBox Manager" window, click "File > Preferences", then select the "Network" tab.
- There should be a host-only network already created. Select it and click the screwdriver icon.
- Note details of Host-Only Network for later::

    Adapter
    - Network name: $HOST_ONLY_NETWORK_NAME
    - IPv4 Address: $HOST_ONLY_NETWORK_IPV4_ADDRESS (ex: 192.168.56.1)
    
    DHCP Server
    - Enable server: YES
    - Server Address: $HOST_ONLY_DHCP_SERVER_ADDRESS (ex: 192.168.56.100)
    - Server Mask: $HOST_ONLY_NETWORK_DHCP_SERVER_MASK (ex: 255.255.255.0)
    - Lower Address Bound: $HOST_ONLY_NETWORK_DHCP_LOWER_BOUND (ex: 192.168.56.101)
    - Upper Address Bound: $HOST_ONLY_NETWORK_DHCP_UPPER_BOUND (ex: 192.168.56.254)




Basic VM Setup
==============

The following steps are common to almost any good VM setup.  There's nothing here that is specific to DDR.



Create a new virtual machine
----------------------------

In the "VirtualBox Manager" window, click "Machine > New", then select the following options from the various screens that follow::

    Name and operating system
    - Name: ddrworkbench-$PARTNERCODE
    - Type: Linux
    - Version: Debian (64-bit)
    
    Memory Size
    - 2048 MB
    
    Hard Drive
    - Create a virtual hard drive now
    
    Hard drive file type
    - VDI
    
    Storage on physical hard drive
    - Dynamically allocated
    
    File location and size
    - Same name as VM
    - 8.00 GB



Networking
----------

VMs do not automatically have access to the host-only network.  This step simulates plugging a network cable into your virtual machine and connecting it to the network.

- Right-click on the new VM, select Settings, then choose "Network" in the window.
- Confirm that Adapter 1 has the following settings, then enable and configure Adapter 2::

    Adapter 1
    - Enable Network Adapter: YES
    - Attached to: NAT
    - Leave all other settings untouched.
    
    Adapter 2
    - Enable Network Adapter: YES
    - Attached to: Host-only Adapter
    - Name: $HOST_ONLY_NETWORK_NAME
    - Leave all other settings untouched.



Shared Folders
--------------

The `ddr-local` virtual machine will take in media documents from your workstation, process them, and deposit them on a USB hard drive.
VirtualBox VMs can only access designated directories in the host filesystem.
In order for `ddr-local` to be able to ingest documents, you must designate a directory on your workstation into which you will deposit the documents.

- Right-click on the VM, select Settings, then choose "Shared Folders" in the window.
- Click "Add shared folder" icon on right side.
- Browse and select folder.
- Folder Name: "ddrshared"
  
  - Read-only: NO
  - Auto-mount: YES
  - Make Permanent: YES



Download Debian Stable
---------------------------------

- http://www.debian.org/distrib/
- Click on "64-bit PC netinst iso" to start the download.
- Note the location of the downloaded file: `$DEBIAN_ISO`.

Security Hardening
-----------------

`ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a simple interface for the built-in `iptables` software firewall.  The following steps will set the firewall to block all traffic except secure shell (ssh) and HTTP.::

    # apt-get install ufw
    # ufw allow 22/tcp
    # ufw allow 80/tcp
    # ufw allow 9001/tcp
    # ufw enable
    # ufw status
    Status: active
     
    To                         Action      From
    --                         ------      ----
    22/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
    22/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
    80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
    80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
    9001/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere
    9001/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

Install the SSH server and `fail2ban`, a daemon that shuts down some types of automated SSH hacking::

    # apt-get install openssh-server fail2ban

Disable login for `root`.  Find the line containing `PermitRootLogin` and change the setting from `yes` to `no`.::

    # nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Restart SSH::

    # /etc/init.d/ssh restart



Adding other appliances 
-----------------

These are appliances that are highly useful in day-to-day troubleshooting and monitering

::
    $ apt-get update && apt-get install sudo byobu glances nfs-common


Snapshot
--------

You now have a basic Debian Linux server setup.  This is a good time to take a snapshot of your VM.

* In the VirtualBox Manager window, right-click on your VM and choose "Close > Save State".
* Click the "Snapshots" button.
* Click the "Take a Snapshot" icon or type Ctl+Shift+S.
* Wait fo the process to complete.
* Right-click on your VM and click "Start" to resume your installation.

If something goes wrong while installing the DDR, or if the developer makes a non-backwards-compatible change to the software, you can always come back to this point and not have to start from the very beginning.



DDR Applications and Dependencies
=================================

It is recommended to install `ddr-local` from a package repository, since your install will receive upgrades automatically as part of the normal system package update process.

**Adding the Repository**

Add the packaging signing key using the `apt-key` tool and then add the repository itself to your list of APT sources.  Commands for accomplishing this are listed below (for completeness we include commands to install curl and the apt tools - you may already have these installed).
::
    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install curl apt-transport-https gnupg
    $ curl -s https://packages.densho.org/debian/keys/archive.asc | sudo apt-key add -

Next add the appopriate entry to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`.

For Debian 8 (Jessie):
::
    $ echo "deb https://packages.densho.org/debian/ jessie main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/densho.list

For Debian 9 (Stretch):
::
    $ echo "deb https://packages.densho.org/debian/ stretch main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/densho.list

**Installing the Package**

You can now install the DDR Editor with the following commands (substitute 'master' with a branch name if you are installing a branch, e.g. 'develop'):
::
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install ddrlocal-master

*Updating the Editor*

Once the package is installed you can get updates as part of the normal system update/upgrade process:
::
    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade


The DDR user
------------

IMPORTANT: The editor run as the `ddr` user, which is installed as part of the package install.  In the Densho HQ environment, it is *critical* that the `ddr` user has the uid and gid set to `1001`.  In other cases this likely does not matter.

User uid and gid are set in `/etc/passwd`.  If both of these commands return the same output you are good.
::
    $ cat /etc/passwd | grep ddr
    ddr:x:1001:1001::/home/ddr:/bin/bash
    $ cat /etc/passwd | grep 1001
    ddr:x:1001:1001::/home/ddr:/bin/bash

The installer should have set up the user/group properly but just in case you can change it manually; do this as soon after setting up the VM as possible.
::
    $ cd /opt/ddr-local/
    $ sudo make ddr-user


Network interfaces
-------------------------

Use the Makefile to install a networking config file to set the VM to a standard IP address (192.168.56.101).
::
    $ cd /opt/ddr-local/
    $ sudo make network-config
    $ sudo reboot

Log in and confirm that you have IP addresses for both network interfaces (`eth0` and `eth1`)
::
    # on Debian 8 / jessie
    $ sudo ifconfig
    # on Debian 9 / stretch
    $ sudo ip address

Either of these commands should return something like the following
::
    eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:40:b8:f8
              inet addr:10.0.2.15  Bcast:10.0.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
              ...
    
    eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:e8:cc:63
              inet addr:192.168.56.101  Bcast:192.168.56.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
              ...
    
    lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
              inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
              ...

Ping a common domain name and confirm that you get a response::

    $ ping google.com
    PING google.com (74.125.224.168) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from lax02s01-in-f8.1e100.net (74.125.224.168): icmp_req=1 ttl=51 time=10.6 ms
    64 bytes from lax02s01-in-f8.1e100.net (74.125.224.168): icmp_req=2 ttl=51 time=9.80 ms
    64 bytes from lax02s01-in-f8.1e100.net (74.125.224.168): icmp_req=3 ttl=51 time=10.6 ms



Install VirtualBox Guest Additions
----------------------------------

source: http://virtualboxes.org/doc/installing-guest-additions-on-debian/

The Makefile can install VirtualBox Guest Additions, which is required
for accessing shared directories on the host system.
::
    $ cd /opt/ddr-local/
    $ sudo make vbox-guest

This step requires you to click "Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD
Image" in the device window.



Configuration
-------------

Repository-wide specifications and configurations are stored in a `ddr` repo that will be installed below.

Most settings are in `/etc/ddr/ddr.cfg`.  Settings in `/etc/ddr/local.cfg` will override settings in `/etc/ddr/ddr.cfg`, so `local.cfg` may be used to customize your setup.  These files are shared by `ddr-local`, `ddr-cmdln`, and `ddr-public`.

Settings specific to Django are in `/usr/local/src/ddr-public/ddrpublic/ddrpublic/settings.py`.

If this will be a stand-alone workstation or if you are using a Qumulo-style NFS and this machine will be the one to run the background indexing processes, run the following to set up and start the background process.::

    $ cd /opt/ddr-local/
    $ sudo make enable-bkgnd

`ddr-local` doesn't use the Django ORM for much, but you have to create a database anyway::

    $ cd /opt/ddr-local/
    $ sudo make syncdb



Elasticsearch
-------------

Local search is optionally provided by Elasticsearch. You can install it thusly:
::
    $ cd /opt/ddr-local/
    $ sudo make get-elasticsearch
    $ sudo make install-elasticsearch

The Elasticsearch service is disabled by default.  To enable it at boot
::
    $ sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service

The `ddrindex` command uses the Elasticsearch config from the `[public]` section because reasons. You can override that selection in `/etc/ddr/ddrlocal-local.cfg`.
::
    $ sudo vi /etc/ddr/ddrlocal-local.cfg

Add the following to the local config file.  You must add host and index settings to both the `[local]` and `[public]` settings.  `[local]` settings refer to the Elasticsearch index used by this copy of the DDR editor.  `[public]` settings refer to the index used by the public web sites.  Note that the `[local]` section requires a `docstore_enabled` setting before editor search functions will work.:
::
    [local]
    docstore_enabled=True
    docstore_host=10.0.1.127:9200
    docstore_index=ddrlocal
    
    [public]
    docstore_host=10.0.127:9200
    docstore_index=ddrlocal

docstore_hosts should point to where the elasticsearch server is running; if this is at the denshohq point it at Kyuzo. If it is a partner VM it should point at the local machine.:
::

Follow `ddrindex` instructions to set up an Elasticsearch index for local searching.
::
    $ cd /opt/ddr-local
    $ sudo su ddr
    ddr$ source /opt/ddr-local/venv/ddrlocal/bin/activate
    ddr$ ddrindex status
    ddr$ ddrindex conf
    ddr$ ddrindex status
    ddr$ ddrindex help



Restart
-------

Restart the servers and the web application to see the effects of your edits.::

    $ cd /opt/ddr-local/
    $ sudo make restart


Switching branches
------------------

*Package Install*

The DDR editor is available in two branches: master and develop.
The master branch is more stable and is intended for production use.
The develop branch is for more cutting edge features that may not be quite ready for the master branch.

It is not recommended that you switch branches manually, as updates will probably damage your install.
If you wish to use the develop branch instead of the master branch, remove `ddrlocal-master` and install `ddrlocal-develop`.
::
    $ sudo apt-get remove ddrlocal-master
    $ sudo apt-get install ddrlocal-develop



Test Drive!
-----------

At this point, you should be able to interact with the DDR-Local web application using a web browser on your host computer. (Restarting nginx or a reboot may be necessary)::

    http://192.168.56.101/

If you do not have a Store installed (see below) you will see errors when you try to view the collections list of other pages that require actual data.



Snapshot
--------

This would be a good time to take another snapshot of your VM.




Site-Specific Steps
===================

Nearly everything we have done up to this point will be the same from one VM to the next.
The following steps will "personalize" this VM as belonging to a particular user/organization. 

.. note::
    These procedures also require access to the DDR gitolite-admin master repo. For security reasons, do not clone the gitolite-admin repo to the VM itself. All operations with the gitolite-admin repo should only be performed on a secure, trusted machine! 



Generate SSH keys
-----------------

We use Gitolite to manage access to the various repositories on the sandbox server.
Gitolite allows or refuses access based on SSH public keys.
Normally users use their own personal keys.
In our case, each DDR VM has its own unique key.

SSH keys include a username and domain name at the end.  Usually this matches the name of the user to which the key belongs.  In our case, the web applications forevery DDR VM will be running as the user `ddr`, but we want the SSH key to be unique to the VM.

Create a second user with a username matching the organization (`$ORGANIZATION`)::

    # adduser $ORGANIZATION
    [enter info]

Become the `$ORGANIZATION` user and generate a passwordless SSH key. (Accept the default names and paths for the keyfiles -- i.e., `$ORGANIZATION/home/.ssh/id_rsa` and `$ORGANIZATION/home/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` Do not choose custom names or gitolite will not function correctly.).::

    # su - $ORGANIZATION
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
    [don't enter a passphrase]
    $ exit

As `root`, copy the newly-created private and public keys to the `ddr` user's home directory and make the keys owned by that user.::

    # cp -R /home/$ORGANIZATION/.ssh /home/ddr
    # chown -R ddr.ddr /home/ddr/.ssh

Copy `ddr`'s **public** key to a machine that has a copy of the gitolite-admin repository (using sFTP or `scp`).  The public key is: `/home/ddr/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.


Add Workstation access to DDR
-----------------------------

On a machine that has a copy of the `gitolite-admin` repository, add the public key.  Rename the key from `id_rsa.pub` to `$ORGANIZATION@ddrlocal$NUM.pub`::

    $ cd /PATH/TO/gitolite-admin
    $ cp /PATH/TO/id_rsa.pub ./keydir/$ORGANIZATION@ddrlocal$NUM.pub

Edit `conf/gitolite.conf` to grant access to the user.
The organization's section should look like the following.
Please refer to the Gitolite manual for questions).
Replace "organization" with the keyword for the organization, seen elsewhere as `$ORGANIZATION`.::

    # ORGANIZATION - - - - - - - - - - - - -
     
    @organization = organization
     
    repo ddr-organization-[0-9]+
      C     = @admins @densho @organization
      RW+   = @admins
      RW    = @organization
     
    repo ddr-organization-[0-9]+-[0-9]+
      C     = @admins @densho @organization
      RW+   = @admins
      RW    = @organization

Add the pubkey and updated conf file and push to the Gitolite server.::

    $ git add keydir/$ORGANIZATION@ddrlocal$NUM.pub
    $ git add conf/gitolite.conf
    $ git commit -m "Added key: $ORGANIZATION@ddrlocal$NUM.pub"
    $ git push

On the VM, log in as the `ddr` user and confirm that the user now has access.::

    $ su - ddr
    ddr@pnr:~$ ssh git@mits.densho.org
    The authenticity of host 'mits.densho.org (216.168.60.179)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is a1:0b:04:28:61:88:c6:00:59:4c:8f:36:d3:1f:8c:c8.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

     R W C  ddr-testing-[0-9]+-[0-9]+
     ...
    Connection to mits.densho.org closed.



USB Hard Drive
--------------

The DDR application is designed to store collection repositories on an attached USB hard drive. This portion of the VM prep procedure should only be performed if the USB drive will be sent along with the VM for installation at the partner site. If the partner has an existing USB drive at their location that will be used for the DDR, this step is unnecessary. The USB drive configuration should be performed at the partner location.


**Preparing a USB Drive**

To prepare a USB drive for the DDR,:

- format the drive as NTFS,
- create a `ddr/` directory in the drive's root directory.


**Configuring the VM to use the USB Drive**

This step configures VirtualBox to automatically attach the USB device to this VM whenever it (the VM) is running.

.. note::
    Once you set up a filter, your VM will expect the USB device to remain attached! If you unplug the device and try to use the VM you will see anomalous behavior!

- Attach the USB hard drive that you plan to use to your computer.
- Wait for the device to appear in your computer's list of drives before proceeding.
- In the VM window, click on "Devices > USB Devices" and select the device in the pop-up menu.  If you have your computer's list of drives visible, you should see the USB device disappear from the list.
- In the VM window, click on "Machine > Settings" and select "USB" from the left-hand side menu.
- Click the "Add Filter From Device" icon and select the device from the pop-up menu.

If you need to remove the device, follow the opposite procedure:

- In the VM window, click on "Machine > Settings" and select "USB" from the left-hand side menu.
- Select the device from the "USB Device Filters" box.
- Click the "Remove USB filter" icon.
- In the VM window, click on "Devices > USB Devices" and un-check the device in the pop-up menu.  If you have your computer's list of drives visible, you should see the USB device reappear in the list.

.. note::
    Because each USB drive will have a unique name/signature, you will need to perform this procedure each time you swap in a new drive for a full one being sent back to Densho HQ.


Disk Image
----------

Alternative to keeping collections on a USB hard drive (1.5.3)

**Preparing a Disk Image**

Before you start, note the device names, filesystems, and sizes for device that are attached to the system.  This is to avoid accidentally reformatting the wrong device.  A number of tools provide this information.::

    $ df 
    Filesystem               1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on

In this case, `/dev/sdc1` is a USB drive formatted as a DDR drive.  `/dev/sda` is not listed here but if you installed according to this document's instructions it contains the boot partition, operating system, and other files for the VM.

Create the new virtual disk in VirtualBox.

- Shut down the VM if it is running.
- In VirtualBox Manager, right-click on the VM and choose Settings.
- Under "Storage," notice that the SATA controller is the second item in the storage tree. Underneath should be a VMDK file named after the VM (e.g. "ddrworkbench.vmdk").
- Click on the SATA controller.  You should see the "Add CD/DVD Device" and "Add Hard Disk" icons. Click the hard disk.
- In the pop-up dialog, choose "Create new disk".
- On the hard drive file type screen select "VMDK". Other choices are certainly valid, though VMDK files are also readable by VMware.
- On the storage type screen choose "Fixed size".
- Give the virtual harddrive file a name and configure the size.

Creating the disk image may take a long time.  When it is finished, start the VM.

- Get the device ID from `fdisk`.  It will be a device that previously didn't exist and so should not match the information you collected above.  Since you just created the disk image it most likely is not formatted, so look for a "Disk /dev/DEVICE doesn't contain a valid partition table" message.  Note that `/dev/sda` is almost certainly the drive that contains the VM's operating system, so don't select that.::

    $ sudo fdisk -l
    [sudo] password for USERNAME:

    Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes

    Disk /dev/sdb doesn't contain a valid partition table
    
    ...

- Create a single partition that fills the disk image.::

    $ sudo su
    root@pnr:/home/gjost# fdisk /dev/sdb
    Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel
    Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x59565fb0.
    Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
    After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

- Make a directory to serve as the mount point.  Replace "DISKNAME" with the disk image name.::

    # mkdir /media/DISKNAME

- Add the new partition to `fstab` so it is mounted automatically on startup.::

    # vi /etc/fstab
    
    # Add the following line to the end of the file:
    /dev/sdb1    /media/DISKNAME    ext4    defaults,noatime    0    2

- Reboot the VM.

Finally, prep for use with ddr-local.  Make a `ddr` folder at the root of the drive that is owned by the `ddr` user.::

    # mkdir /media/DISKNAME/ddr
    # chown -R ddr.ddr /media/DISKNAME/ddr


**Configuring the VM to use the Disk Image**



Repository-wide configuration
=============================

Repository-wide specifications and configurations are stored in a `ddr` repo.  Create a base directory and clone the `ddr` repo to it.::

    # git clone USER@HOST:PATH/ddr.git /media/DISKNAME/ddr/ddr

Note that if you are testing code you may need to switch branches in the `ddr` repo.  Please see the "Switching branches" section.
